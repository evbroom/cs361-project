Return to oven and bake for an additional 15 minutes.  Remove from oven and serve.', 'NOTE:  Duck always benefits from this precooking, cooling, and rebaking.  The cooling process releases most of the oil from the duck and the second cooking crisps it beautifully.  This duck should be started way ahead of time, as the duck must cool after the first roasting.  Be certain the duck is very crispy before serving.']"
